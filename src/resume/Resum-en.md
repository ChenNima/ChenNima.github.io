# Working Experience

## SAP Labs China （ 2016.10 ~  ）

### Devops/SAP Jam Collaboration （ 2019.2 ~  ）
SAP Jam Collaboration(a.k.a Jam) is a collaboration tool based on `Ruby on Rails` as backend and `React`，`BackboneJS` as frontend. My major job is migrating the whole project to `Kubernetes` and deploy on AWS after joining the Devops Team. What I have done including programming `Terraform` for managing infrastructure; Splitting and decoupling micro services into individual `Helm` Charts and deploying them separately; Deploying `Istio` service mesh and implementing canary deployment, traffic monitoring and etc.

### Web Developer/SAP Jam Collaboration （ 2017.10 ~  ）
I'm also focus on frontend development. Jam is a complicated application using `React`，`BackboneJS` and `Rails ERB` template rendering as frontend solution, and `Webpack`/`Gulp`/`Rails assets pipeline` as bundling tool. At early stage, my job was creating frontend components. But my major job is organizing code architecture, code reviewing, code slitting/decoupling and solving hard problems. I created an abstract layer for combine `BackboneJS` and `React` components organically, implemented division of new and old code. Migrate new features' development to using `React`/`Typescript`/`Styled-Component` tech-stack while not affect old code and feature.

### Frontend Developer/SAP Jam Community （ 2016.10 ~  2017.10）
SAP Jam Community is a social platform based on `EmberJS`/`Vue` and `Ruby on rails`. During this period of job, my major job was frontend developing. Other then creating `EmberJS` component, I also wrote a front-back-end-separated management tool using `Vue`.
